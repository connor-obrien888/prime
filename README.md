# PRIME
PRIME (Probabilistic Regressor for Input to the Magnetosphere Estimation) is a probabilistic algorithm that uses solar wind time history from L1 monitors to generate predictions of near-Earth solar wind with uncertainties. A paper describing PRIME is currently pending publication, once published the beta version implemented in keras for python will be released here.
