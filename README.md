PRIME (Probabilistic Regressor for Input to the Magnetosphere Estimation) is a probabilistic algorithm that uses solar wind time history from L1 monitors to generate predictions of near-Earth solar wind with uncertainties. For codes used to create the figures in the paper, see the 'paper' subdirectory. A python implementation and CDF outputs will be made available after the paper is peer reviewed.
